# GeoFlag

GeoFlag displays a flag icon indicating the current webserver's physical location. Knowing where you're connected to adds an extra layer of awareness to your browsing and can be useful to indicate the native languages and legal jurisdictions that may apply. Additional information can be obtained via a multitude of external lookups and users can add their own custom actions. All actions can be added to the flag icon's context menu and set to icon click or keyboard shortcuts for quick access.
