/* This file exists solely to appease a recent bug in mozIJSSubScriptLoader which bizarrely keeps a kung fu death grip cache of files it loads past Firefox restarts and addon updates (but fortunately, not Firefox updates). The ignoreCache flag does nothing. Not only do new addon versions choke when fed an old versions' file, but even after removing this file and all use of this API, Firefox might still try to load it, and then break the addon load because it doesn't exist anymore. It might even still choke if this dummy file doesn't have the symbols it expects. This is really stupid, so clearly it can only be fixed with a stupid hack like this. */
