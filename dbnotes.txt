Geo IP databases are loaded from the RealityRipple Software website by default, with GZ compression and ECDSA signing.
Databases are updated once a week to once a month by config preference. The server updates weekly on Tuesday nights.

The server sends two additional headers with each database, 'X-Signature-R' and 'X-Signature-S', which contain the hexidecimal R and S ECDSA signature values.

The URLs for the databases can be modified with the 'extensions.geoflag.db.v4.url' and 'extensions.geoflag.db.v6.url' preferences.

The ECDSA signature curve, hash algorithm, and public key can also be modified with 'extensions.geoflag.db.ecdsa.curve', 'extensions.geoflag.db.ecdsa.hash', and 'extensions.geoflag.db.ecdsa.key' respectively.

Valid values for 'curve' are 'P-256', 'P-384', and 'P-521'.
Valid values for 'hash' are 'SHA-256', 'SHA-384', and 'SHA-512'.
Valid values for 'key' are '04' + X coordinate + Y coordinate in hexidecimal, standardized as the Uncompressed Public Key format in RFC 5480. JavaScript does not understand compressed public keys at this time.

If 'curve' or 'hash' are invalid, or if 'key' is empty, the ECDSA verification process will be skipped when retrieving new databases.


Database layouts are extremely simple: Start of Range, End of Range, 2-Char Country Code

For IPv4, the Start and End are 4 bytes each. Each range is 10 bytes.
 192.168.0.1 would be stored as C0 A8 00 01.
 An example line would be: 4ACEA0004AD1FFFF5553
  which means 74.206.160.0 - 74.209.255.255 = US

For IPv4, the Start and End are 16 bytes each. Each range is 34 bytes.
 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 would be stored as 20 01 0D B8 85 A3 00 00 00 00 8A 2E 03 70 73 34
 An example line would be: 2A009CE00000000000000000000000002A009CE0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF4742
  which means 2a00:9ce0:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 - 2a00:9ce0:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff = GB

Aside from standard ISO country codes, the custom codes 'A1' and 'A2' also exist. A1 is for anonymous (proxy) IPs, and A2 is for satellite internet IPs.
